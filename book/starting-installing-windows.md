# Windows Installation Instructions

<aside class="note">
Although Windows is officially supported, we discourage its use. It is considerably slower during Firmware compilation. It also cannot run the standard robotics software packages many developers use to prototype computer vision and navigation. Before starting to develop on Windows, consider installing a dual-boot environment with [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com).

Now continue to run the [first build](starting-building.md)!
