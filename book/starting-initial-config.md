# Initial Configuration

Before starting to develop on PX4, the system should be configured initially with a default configuration to ensure the hardware is set up properly and is tested. The video below explains the setup process with [Pixhawk hardware](hardware-pixhawk.md) and [QGroundControl](qgroundcontrol-intro.md). A list of supported reference airfames is [here](airframes-architecture.md).
