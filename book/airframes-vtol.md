# VTOL Airframes

The [PX4 Flight Stack](concept-flight-stack.md) supports virtually all VTOL configurations:

  * Tailsitters (duo and quadrotors in X and plus configuration)
  * Tiltrotors (Firefly Y6)
  * Standard plane VTOL (plane plus quad)

The VTOL codebase is the same codebase as for all other airframes and just adds additional control logic, in particular for transitions.
