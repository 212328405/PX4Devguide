# Building PX4 Software

PX4 can be built on the console or in a graphical development environment / IDE.

## Compiling on the Console

Before moving on to a graphical editor or IDE, it is important to validate the system setup. Do so by bringing up the terminal. On OS X, hit âŒ˜-space and search for 'terminal'. On Ubuntu, click the launch bar and search for 'terminal'. On Windows, find the PX4 folder in the start menu and click on 'PX4 Console'.

The terminal starts in the home directory. We default to '~/src/Firmware' and clone the upstream repository. Experienced developers might clone [their fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) instead.

<div class="host-code"></div>

```sh
mkdir -p ~/src
cd ~/src
git clone https://github.com/PX4/Firmware.git
cd Firmware
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd ..
```
Now its time to build the binaries by compiling the source code. But before going straight to the hardware, a [simulation run](simulation-sitl.md) is recommended as the next step. Users preferring to work in a graphical development environment should continue with the next section.

### NuttX / Pixhawk based boards

<div class="host-code"></div>

```sh
cd Firmware
make px4fmu-v2_default
```

Note the syntax: 'make' is the build tool, 'px4fmu-v2' is the hardware / autopilot version and 'default' is the default configuration. All PX4 build targets follow this logic. A successful run will end with this output:

<div class="host-code"></div>

```sh
[100%] Linking CXX executable firmware_nuttx
[100%] Built target firmware_nuttx
Scanning dependencies of target build_firmware_px4fmu-v2
[100%] Generating nuttx-px4fmu-v2-default.px4
[100%] Built target build_firmware_px4fmu-v2
```

By appending 'upload' to these commands the compiled binary will be uploaded via USB to the autopilot hardware:

<div class="host-code"></div>

```sh
make px4fmu-v2_default upload
```

A successful run will end with this output:

<div class="host-code"></div>

```sh
Erase  : [====================] 100.0%
Program: [====================] 100.0%
Verify : [====================] 100.0%
Rebooting.

[100%] Built target upload
```
### Raspberry Pi 2 boards
The command below builds the target for Raspbian (posix_pi2_release).

<div class="host-code"></div>

```sh
cd Firmware
make posix_rpi2_release # for cross-compiler build
```

The "mainapp" executable file is in the directory build_posix_rpi2_release/src/firmware/posix.
Copy it over to the RPi (replace YOUR_PI with the IP or hostname of your RPi, [instructions how to access your RPi](hardware-pi2.md#developer-quick-start))

```sh
scp build_posix_rpi2_release/src/firmware/posix/mainapp pi@YOUR_PI:/home/pi/
```

And run it with :
<div class="host-code"></div>

```sh
./mainapp
```


If you're building *directly* on the Pi, you will want the native build target (posix_pi2_default).

<div class="host-code"></div>

```sh
cd Firmware
make posix_rpi2_default # for native build
```

The "mainapp" executable file is in the directory build_posix_rpi2_default/src/firmware/posix.
Run it directly with :
<div class="host-code"></div>

```sh
./build_posix_rpi2_default/src/firmware/posix/mainapp
```

A successful build followed by executing mainapp will give you this :

<div class="host-code"></div>

```sh
[init] shell id: 1996021760
[init] task name: mainapp

______  __   __    ___
| ___ \ \ \ / /   /   |
| |_/ /  \ V /   / /| |
|  __/   /   \  / /_| |
| |     / /^\ \ \___  |
\_|     \/   \/     |_/

Ready to fly.

### QuRT / Snapdragon based boards

The commands below build the targets for the Linux and the DSP side. Both executables communicate via [muORB](advanced-uorb.md).

<div class="host-code"></div>

```sh
cd Firmware
make posix_eagle_default
make qurt_eagle_default
```

To set up the development environment, see [Getting Started](https://github.com/ATLFlight/ATLFlightDocs/blob/master/GettingStarted.md). You must be able to do a graphical install of the Hexagon tools so a remote shell to the machine will not work.
Use the [HelloWorld](https://github.com/ATLFlight/ATLFlightDocs/blob/master/HelloWorld.md) and [dspal_tester](https://github.com/ATLFlight/dspal/blob/master/README.md) instructions to verify your setup is correct.

The quick instructions are:

Get the [SDK](https://developer.qualcomm.com/download/hexagon/hexagon-sdk-linux.bin) and Hexagon tools 7.2.10 installers.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ATLFlight/cross_toolchain.git
mv qualcomm_hexagon_sdk_2_0_eval.bin cross_toolchain/downloads
mv Hexagon.LLVM_linux_installer_7.2.10.bin cross_toolchain/downloads
./cross_toolchain/install.sh
```

Follow the instructions to set up the development environment. If you accept all the installl defaults you can at any time re-run the following to get the env setup. It will only install missing components.
```sh
./cross_toolchain/install.sh

Make sure to set the following environment variables:
   export HEXAGON_SDK_ROOT=${HOME}/Qualcomm/Hexagon_SDK/2.0
   export HEXAGON_TOOLS_ROOT=${HOME}/Qualcomm/HEXAGON_Tools/7.2.10/Tools
   export HEXAGON_ARM_SYSROOT=${HOME}/Qualcomm/Hexagon_SDK/2.0/sysroot
   export PATH=${HEXAGON_SDK_ROOT}/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-4.8-2013.08_linux/bin:$PATH

```

Clone current master:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/PX4/Firmware.git
cd Firmware
make posix_eagle_default
make qurt_eagle_default
```

To load the SW on the device, connect via USB cable and make sure the device is booted. In another terminal do:
```sh
adb shell
```
If that works, go back to previous terminal:
```sh
cd build_posix_eagle_default
make mainapp-load
cd build_qurt_eagle_default
make libmainapp-load
```
Or all in one line:
```sh
make posix_eagle_default && (cd build_posix_eagle_default && make mainapp-load) && make qurt_eagle_default && (cd build_qurt_eagle_default && make libmainapp-load)
```

Copy the startup files:
```sh
adb push posix-configs/eagle/flight/mainapp-flight.config /home/linaro/mainapp.config
adb push posix-configs/eagle/flight/px4-flight.config /usr/share/data/adsp/px4.config
```

Run the DSP debug monitor:
```sh
${HEXAGON_SDK_ROOT}/tools/mini-dm/Linux_Debug/mini-dm
```

Go back to ADB shell and run mainapp:
```sh
cd /home/linaro
./mainapp mainapp.config
```

## Compiling in a graphical IDE

The PX4 system supports Qt Creator, Eclipse and Sublime Text. Qt Creator is the most user-friendly variant and hence the only officially supported IDE. Unless an expert in Eclipse or Sublime, their use is discouraged. Hardcore users can find an [Eclipse project](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/.project) and a [Sublime project](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/Firmware.sublime-project) in the source tree.

## Qt Creator Functionality

Qt creator offers clickable symbols, auto-completion of the complete codebase and building and flashing firmware.

![](images/toolchain/qtcreator.png)

### Qt Creator on Linux

<aside class="note">
Linux users can just load the CMakeLists.txt in the root firmware folder via File -> Open File or Project -> Select the CMakeLists.txt file.
</aside>

After loading, the 'play' button can be configured to run the project by selecting 'custom executable' in the run target configuration and entering 'make' as executable and 'upload' as argument.

### Qt Creator on Windows

<aside class="todo">
Windows has not been tested with Qt creator yet.
</aside>

### Qt Creator on Mac OS

Before starting Qt Creator, the [project file](https://cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_Generator_Specific_Information#Code::Blocks_Generator) needs to be created:

<div class="host-code"></div>

```sh
cd ~/src/Firmware
mkdir build_creator
cd build_creator
cmake .. -G "CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles"
```

That's it! Start Qt Creator, then complete the steps in the video below to set up the project to build.
