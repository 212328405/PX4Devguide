# Building PX4 Software

PX4 can be built on the console or in a graphical development environment / IDE.

## Compiling on the Console

Before moving on to a graphical editor or IDE, it is important to validate the system setup. Do so by bringing up the terminal. On OS X, hit âŒ˜-space and search for 'terminal'. On Ubuntu, click the launch bar and search for 'terminal'. On Windows, find the PX4 folder in the start menu and click on 'PX4 Console'.

The terminal starts in the home directory. We default to '~/src/Firmware' and clone the upstream repository. Experienced developers might clone [their fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) instead.

<div class="host-code"></div>

```sh
mkdir -p ~/src
cd ~/src
git clone https://github.com/PX4/Firmware.git
```
Now its time to build the binaries by compiling the source code.

<div class="host-code"></div>

```sh
cd Firmware
make px4fmu-v2_default
```

Note the syntax: 'make' is the build tool, 'px4fmu-v2' is the hardware / autopilot version and 'default' is the default configuration. All PX4 build targets follow this logic. A successful run will end with this output:

<div class="host-code"></div>

```sh
[100%] Linking CXX executable firmware_nuttx
[100%] Built target firmware_nuttx
Scanning dependencies of target build_firmware_px4fmu-v2
[100%] Generating nuttx-px4fmu-v2-default.px4
[100%] Built target build_firmware_px4fmu-v2
```

By appending 'upload' to these commands the compiled binary will be uploaded via USB to the autopilot hardware:

<div class="host-code"></div>

```sh
make px4fmu-v2_default upload
```

A successful run will end with this output:

<div class="host-code"></div>

```sh
Erase  : [====================] 100.0%
Program: [====================] 100.0%
Verify : [====================] 100.0%
Rebooting.

[100%] Built target upload
```

But before going straight to the hardware, a [simulation run](simulation-sitl.md) is recommended as the next step. Users preferring to work in a graphical development environment should continue with the next section.

## Compiling in a graphical IDE

The PX4 system supports Qt Creator, Eclipse and Sublime Text. Qt Creator is the most user-friendly variant and hence the only officially supported IDE. Unless an expert in Eclipse or Sublime, their use is discouraged. Hardcore users can find an [Eclipse project](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/.project) and a [Sublime project](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/Firmware.sublime-project) in the source tree.

## Qt Creator Functionality

Qt creator offers clickable symbols, auto-completion of the complete codebase and building and flashing firmware.

### Qt Creator on Linux

<aside class="note">
Linux users can just load the CMakeLists.txt in the root firmware folder via File -> Open File or Project -> Select the CMakeLists.txt file.
</aside>

After loading, the 'play' button can be configured to run the project by selecting 'custom executable' in the run target configuration and entering 'make' as executable and 'upload' as argument.

### Qt Creator on Windows

<aside class="todo">
Windows has not been tested with Qt creator yet.
</aside>

### Qt Creator on Mac OS

Before starting Qt Creator, the [project file](https://cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_Generator_Specific_Information#Code::Blocks_Generator) needs to be created:

<div class="host-code"></div>

```sh
cd ~/src/Firmware
mkdir build_creator
cd build_creator
cmake .. -G "CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles"
```

That's it! Start Qt Creator, then complete the steps in the video below to set up the project to build.
