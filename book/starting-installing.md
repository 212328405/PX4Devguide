# Installing Files and Code

The PX4 code can be developed on [Mac OS](starting-installation-mac.md), [Linux](starting-installation-linux.md) or [Windows](starting-installation-windows.md). Mac OS and Linux are recommended since image processing and advanced navigation cannot be easily developed on Windows. If unsure, new developers should default to Linux and the current [Ubuntu LTS edition](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS).

## Setting up the Development Environment

  * [Mac OS](starting-installation-mac.md)
  * [Linux](starting-installation-linux.md)
  * [Windows](starting-installation-windows.md)

## Compiling on the Console

Before moving on to a graphical editor or IDE, it is important to validate the system setup. Do so by bringing up the terminal. On OS X, hit âŒ˜-space and search for 'terminal'. On Ubuntu, click the launch bar and search for 'terminal'. On Windows, find the PX4 folder in the start menu and click on 'PX4 Console'.

The terminal starts in the home directory. We default to '~/src/Firmware' and clone the upstream repository. Experienced developers might clone [their fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) instead.

```sh
mkdir -p ~/src
cd ~/src
git clone https://github.com/PX4/Firmware.git
```
Now its time to build the binaries by compiling the source code.

```sh
cd Firmware
make px4fmu-v2_default
```

Note the syntax: 'make' is the build tool, 'px4fmu-v2' is the hardware / autopilot version and 'default' is the default configuration. All PX4 build targets follow this logic. A successful run will end with this output:

```sh
[100%] Linking CXX executable firmware_nuttx
[100%] Built target firmware_nuttx
Scanning dependencies of target build_firmware_px4fmu-v2
[100%] Generating nuttx-px4fmu-v2-default.px4
[100%] Built target build_firmware_px4fmu-v2
```

By appending 'upload' to these commands the compiled binary will be uploaded via USB to the autopilot hardware:

```sh
make px4fmu-v2_default upload
```

A successful run will end with this output:

```sh
Erase  : [====================] 100.0%
Program: [====================] 100.0%
Verify : [====================] 100.0%
Rebooting.

[100%] Built target upload
```

But before going straight to the hardware, a [simulation run](simulation-sitl.md) is recommended as the next step. Users preferring to work in a graphical development environment should continue with the next section.

## Compiling in a graphical IDE

The PX4 system supports Qt Creator, Eclipse and Sublime Text. Qt Creator is the most user-friendly variant and hence the only officially supported IDE. Unless an expert in Eclipse or Sublime, their use is discouraged. Hardcore users can find an [Eclipse project](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/.project) and a [Sublime project](https://github.com/PX4/Firmware/blob/master/Firmware.sublime-project) in the source tree.

Before starting Qt Creator, the [project file](https://cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_Generator_Specific_Information#Code::Blocks_Generator) needs to be created:

```sh
cd ~/src/Firmware
mkdir build_creator
cd build_creator
cmake .. -G "CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles"
```

That's it! Start Qt Creator, then click on *File -> Open File or Project..* and select the file '~/src/Firmware/build_creator/px4.cbp'. Building (the hammer symbol) now already works, and the correct setup to run the project is explained in the video below.
